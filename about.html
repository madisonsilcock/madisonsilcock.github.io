        <h1 id="guarantee"></h1>
        <p>There a lots of pest control companies to choose from, but at NatureWise Pest Control, we go beyond and above the industry standard to guarantee your satisfaction. While other companies only spray around the perimeter of the baseboards of your homeâ€™s exterior, we use a 50 gallon power sprayer to go up the walls and out into the lawn. We treat every crack and crevice of the interior of your home, and even treat attics, basements, garages, sheds, porches, dog kennels and more. To top it all off, every customer agreement includes a pest-free guarantee. When bugs return, so do we. If at any time between regularly scheduled treatments any bugs re-appear, we come back and treat your home for free.</p>
